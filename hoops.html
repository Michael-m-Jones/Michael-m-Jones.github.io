        <p>This new UNC basketball team is filled with high hopes, expectations and talent. After making it all the way to the championship last year the Tar Heels return to get revenge and take home the title. With four out of five starters returning there's quality expreince on the team. Pete nance has come to fill that 5th and final spot that Brady Manek left. Hopefully this year the team can stay injury free and play as a team! There are many questions for the team this year: Will Pete Nance be able to fill the void that Brady Manek left? Will Armando Bacot have another superstar season? Will the team have the same drive as last year? Are the expectations too much pressure on our team? Will we be able to sweep Duke? This season will attempt to answer those.

                  <p>Now that the season is underway we wanted to provide some updates on our team. After starting out the season 5-0 as the number one team in the nation there was a fall from grace. Three straight loses has got Carolina fans up in arms. Are we really that bad? For those who didn't catch it the 2nd lose, to Alabama, was in quadroople overtime giving nearly everyone a heart attack. The team just doesn't look put together in terms of synergy. We aren't sure if Pete Nance is the problem or maybe the expectations from last season are getting in the players heads. Either way stay tuned on our website for more updates regarding all things UNC athletics!! </p>
